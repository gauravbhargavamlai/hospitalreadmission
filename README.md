# Hospital Readmission Prediction - Capstone Project

## Project Overview

This capstone project addresses the $26 billion annual problem of hospital readmissions by building a predictive machine learning model to identify diabetic patients at highest risk of readmission within 30 days of discharge.

**Research Question:** Can we predict which diabetic patients are at highest risk of hospital readmission within 30 days, and what clinical factors drive these readmissions?

---

## Business Context

### The Problem

Hospital readmissions within 30 days represent one of healthcare's most significant challenges:

- **Financial Impact:** $26 billion spent annually on preventable readmissions
- **Medicare Penalties:** Hospitals face up to 3% reduction in Medicare payments for excessive readmissions
- **Patient Outcomes:** Readmissions indicate inadequate care and increase mortality risk
- **Resource Strain:** Readmitted patients consume limited emergency and inpatient capacity

### The Solution

A predictive analytics system that:
1. Identifies high-risk patients before discharge
2. Enables targeted interventions for at-risk populations
3. Optimizes resource allocation for care coordination
4. Reduces preventable readmissions and associated costs

- **Repository:** UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Link:** https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/296/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years-1999-2008
- **Alternative:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brandao/diabetes

### Dataset Characteristics

- **Size:** 101,766 patient encounters
- **Time Period:** 10 years (1999-2008)
- **Institutions:** 130 US hospitals
- **Features:** 50 variables including:
  - Demographics (age, gender, race)
  - Clinical data (diagnoses, procedures, lab tests)
  - Medications (diabetes-specific and general)
  - Healthcare utilization (prior visits, length of stay)
  - Outcomes (readmission status)

### Target Variable

- **Binary Classification:** Readmission within 30 days (Yes/No)
- **Original Distribution:**
  - Not readmitted: 88.9%
  - Readmitted within 30 days: 11.1%
- **Challenge:** Significant class imbalance (8:1 ratio)

## Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Data Quality Assessment:**
- Identified missing values (marked as '?' in dataset)
- weight: 96.9% missing â†’ dropped
- medical_specialty: 49.1% missing â†’ dropped
- payer_code: 40.2% missing â†’ dropped
- race: 2.2% missing â†’ imputed

**Target Variable Analysis:**
- 11,357 patients (11.1%) readmitted within 30 days
- Class imbalance requiring specialized handling techniques

**Univariate Analysis:**
- Examined distributions of 50+ features
- Identified outliers using IQR method
- Analyzed categorical variable frequencies

**Bivariate Analysis:**
- Statistical testing (t-tests) for numerical features vs. readmission
- Chi-square tests for categorical features vs. readmission
- Key findings: prior utilization, procedures, and medications significantly correlate with readmission

### 2. Feature Engineering

Created 9 new features to capture clinical complexity:

| Feature | Description | Rationale |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| `total_utilization` | Sum of outpatient, emergency, and inpatient visits | Captures overall healthcare engagement |
| `num_diabetes_meds` | Count of diabetes medications prescribed | Medication complexity indicator |
| `total_diagnoses_count` | Number of documented diagnoses | Comorbidity burden |
| `age_numeric` | Numeric conversion of age ranges | Enable age-based analysis |
| `procedures_per_day` | Procedures divided by length of stay | Treatment intensity metric |
| `labs_per_day` | Lab tests divided by length of stay | Diagnostic intensity metric |
| `med_complexity` | Medications Ã— diabetes meds | Overall medication burden |
| `high_utilization` | Flag for multiple prior visits | High-risk patient identifier |
| `med_changed` | Medication regimen changed | Treatment adjustment indicator |

### 3. Data Preprocessing

**Handling Missing Values:**
- Dropped columns with >40% missing data
- Replaced '?' with 'Missing' category
- Imputed numeric features with median values

**Feature Encoding:**
- Label encoding for categorical variables
- One-hot encoding considered for low-cardinality features

**Feature Scaling:**
- StandardScaler applied to normalize numerical features
- Critical for distance-based algorithms and neural networks

**Class Imbalance:**
- Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
- Balanced training set from 8:1 to 1:1 ratio
- Preserved original test set for realistic evaluation

### 4. Baseline Model Development

**Model Selection:**
- **Primary:** Logistic Regression (interpretable, fast, baseline)
- **Comparison:** Random Forest (handles non-linearity, feature importance)

**Training Strategy:**
- 80-20 train-test split with stratification
- 5-fold cross-validation for robust performance estimates
- Class weighting and SMOTE for imbalance handling
